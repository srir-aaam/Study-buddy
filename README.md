 **StudyBud â€“ A Student Community Platform (Django Project)**

**StudyBud** is a web-based community platform built with Django, designed to help students collaborate, share knowledge, and learn together. It allows users to:

* Create and join **discussion rooms** on various topics.
* Post and reply to messages within rooms (real-time learning and interaction).
* Manage their **profiles** and see other learners' profiles.
* Search rooms and topics using dynamic filtering.
* Control room access with login/logout and authentication features.

The project emphasizes **CRUD operations**, **user authentication**, **template rendering**, and **Django ORM**. It's ideal for learning core web development with Django.
